//! This module provide a way to identify a tile by its `tile_type_id`.
//!
//! As for exact meaning of *Tile Type* it is mainly left to the direct implementation and use-case, eg. sometimes just
//! the *biome* (like grass tile, water type, desert type etc.) will be distinct types, other times more specific
//! identity will be needed. All these details are left for implementor to decide upon.
//!
//! One thing that should never be taken into account is specific position of the tile in the grid, as it would mean every
//! tile on every grid will be of different type.
//!
//! `tile_type_id` is of [u64] type, which makes it easily implementable by hashing some specific properties of the tile
//! present on the struct.

/// Its implementation makes the specific tile identifiable and discernable from other tile instances in regards to tile

/// when implementing this trait manually should be:
///
/// - its position **should not be ever taken into account**. Tile of these same type could be placed on different positions
///   on the GridMap.
/// - other properties of the tile (such as visual representation) *can* be taken into account depending on your specific
///   needs.
